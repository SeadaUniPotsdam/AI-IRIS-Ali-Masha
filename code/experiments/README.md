# Experiments

The scripts provided here realize experiments that demonstrate the use of the AI-CPS toolset.
In principle, AI requests are triggered via MQTT network structures and the communication client manages the corresponding AI reguests.

Further details can be found at each experiment-specific documentation sub-folder.

The tool and experiments were originally developed by Dr.-Ing. Marcus Grum.
